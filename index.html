            <h3>Fatalities by Time and Day of Week</h3>
            <p>
              There is a clear correlation between weekday and the time of the accident. The least fatal hours are from
              midnight to 7am from Monday to Thursday as there is most likely very few drivers on the road at this time.
              The exception to this is on the weekends, where people are likely to stay out later, potentially under the
              influence.
              The most fatal hours are around <mark class="red">3pm to 6pm</mark>, most likely due to the roads being
              the busiest around these
              times. The number of fatalities begins to decrease from 8pm onwards, except on <mark class="red">Fridays
                and Saturdays</mark> where fatality rates continue to stay high until around 3am.

            <h3>Fatalities in By State and Date</h3>
            <p>
              There is a clear trend of the number of fatalities <mark class="blue">decreasing over the years</mark>
              since 1989,
              which may be as a
              result of many different factors, such as better technology, laws and regulations or education.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main contributors to fatal road accidents are <mark class="red">NSW, Queensland and Victoria</mark>,
              likely due to their larger
              population relative to the other states. You can use the sliders to tweak the year range of the chart, or
              click on the states on the legend to view a single state. You can shift-click additional states to compare
              multiple states at once.

            <h3>Fatalities by Time of Day and State</h3>
            <p>
              Most of the fatalities of road accidents seem to come from <mark class="red">NSW, Queensland and
                Victoria.</mark>. As mentioned, this is most
              likely due to these states being the most populated states of Australia, resulting in a higher likelihood
              of road accidents and death.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the fatalities seem to be evenly split between day and night, there does seem to be a slight skew
              towards night time. We should also consider that there are less drivers during the night time, meaning the
              accidents to drivers ratio would be much higher at night, signifying drivers as being more <mark
                class="red">dangerous</mark>.

            <h3>Fatalities by Time of Day and Speed Limit</h3>

            <p>
              The number of fatalities at each speed limit seems to increase as the speed limit increases, suggesting
              that <mark class="red">high speed</mark> is one of the major influencing factors when it comes to fatal
              accidents. While some of
              the higher speed limits do have relatively lower fatalities, such as 75km and 90km, this is more likely
              due to
              these speed limits being less common.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the night accidents at around the 60km speed limit seems to result in more fatalities when compared
              to its day time counterpart, while during the day the difference between fatalities at 60km and fatalities
              at 100km is larger.

          <h2>Across the States</h2>
          <p>Let's take a closer look at the total number of fatalities in every Australian state. It seems that
            relative to other states, ACT, Victoria and NSW seems to have the highest fatality to road length ratio,
            with the highest ratio of <mark class="red">136 fatalities per 1000km of road</mark> belonging to ACT.
            However,
            these same states are on the lower end when it comes to the fatalities to population ratio, with Northern
            Territory now having the highest ratio of <mark class="red">68 fatalities for every 10 000 people</mark>
